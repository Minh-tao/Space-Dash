# Space Dash
 
Space Dash is a personal project I made from January to March 2022; my goals with the project were to apply my self-taught knowledge of C# and the Unity Engine, and experiment with designing and creating a game. The project is a 2D platformer sci-fi themed platformer game inspired by retro 2D platformers such as Mega Man and Metroid. 

The game's assets and sprites are sourced from itch.io.
